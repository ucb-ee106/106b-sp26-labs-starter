# Project 3: Path Planning with Dijkstra, A* and Optimization

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:

```bash
cd starter/
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

When running turtlebot_controller.py remember to build the ros2 package and to run it with ros2 while NOT in your virtual environment.
